# Revenge of the Pancakes

### What is this?

A short, personal, implementation of the the RotP challenge. This example actually sets
up an AWS Lambda that exposes an endpoint to send the test-cases over that you want solved.
It was a fun little experiment taking just the base of the project a little further and testing
the waters with Go Lambda's and the Serverless framework.

### Getting Started - Service

PRE) Make sure you have the [serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/) 
framework installed and your [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) configured to 
your own account. You'll also need Go and Dep setup in order to build the binaries.

1) `$ cd rotp-go`
2) Create your lambda: `$ make && serverless deploy`
3) Test your lambda: `$ serverless invoke -f rotp-go -p data.json`

-----

### Getting Started - UI

The client is just a simple create-react-app to make calling 
the lambda easier and more custom. 

1) `$ cd rotp-ui`
2) Install dependencies: `$ npm install`
3) Configure your endpoint: `$ vim src/shared/api/base.ts` 
4) Run locally: `$ npm start`

### More info

I've setup a sample request for the serverless framework that can be invoked to sends over 
the following (Base64 encoded) to the endpoint:

```
5
-
-+
+-
+++
--+-
```

Which should respond with the results of the test like so:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "headers": null,
  "body": {
    "data" : [
      {
          "result" : 1,
          "testNumber" : 1,
          "testPattern" : "-"
      },
      {
          "result" : 1,
          "testNumber" : 2,
          "testPattern" : "-+"
      },
      {
          "result" : 2,
          "testNumber" : 3,
          "testPattern" : "+-"
      },
      {
          "result" : 0,
          "testNumber" : 4,
          "testPattern" : "+++"
      },
      {
          "result" : 3,
          "testNumber" : 5,
          "testPattern" : "--+-"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
